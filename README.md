# Motor speed control of titanium tape using bluetooth and a femtosecond pulsed x-ray table-top source

Abstract—Since the aim of mechatronics is to improve the
functionality of technical systems, it may be used to implement
a rotation speed control of a titanium tape in an embedded
system, in order to capture femtosecond x-ray pulses from a
table-top laser source. This embedded system has application in
multidisciplinary areas as in biological systems, where structural
dynamics of myoglobin can be better understood by the capture
of information about the photo-excitation of carbon monoxide, for
example. A low cost embedded system may increase accessibility
in the use of the information stored in the cells and its chemical
and biological reactions concerning, for example, the human
body, once the price of the final system would not be too
high. Then, the control the titanium tape’s rotation speed allows
the correctly understanding of interesting phenomena which
are found in the sup-picosecond time scales not available for
synchrotron techniques, by registering femtosecond x-ray pulses,
which means that a refined analysis of unknown info may be made
afterwards, impacting positively not only the academic domain
by the knowledge acquired, but also the society.
